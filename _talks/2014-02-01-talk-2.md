This presentation introduces **RadSIMU**, an airborne **radiometric simulator** designed for **survey planning** and **mineral targeting**. The talk highlights the development of RadSIMU as a tool to simulate and optimize **gamma-ray spectrometry (AGRS)** surveys using **UAV platforms**.  

Key topics covered in the presentation:
- Simulating **radiometric data acquisition** in complex terrains with **synthetic geological features** such as **faults** and **ridges**.  
- Evaluating the impact of **sensor parameters** (height, sampling rate, and resolution) on **data accuracy** and **detection efficiency**.  
- Designing surveys to detect **radioactive anomalies** using **forward modeling** and **terrain correction methods**.  
- Incorporating **numerical modeling** techniques, including **finite difference methods** and **spectral infinite element methods (SPECFEM)**.  
- Applications of RadSIMU for **mineral exploration**, **environmental monitoring**, and **radiation safety studies**.  

The talk also demonstrated **case studies** with both **real-world data** and **synthetic simulations**, emphasizing the simulatorâ€™s ability to predict and enhance survey performance in **challenging terrains**.
