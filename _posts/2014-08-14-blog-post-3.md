**Compact Inversion of Gravity and Magnetic Data Using Huber Loss Function**  
======  

### **Introduction**  
Gravity and magnetic methods are widely used in geophysics to investigate subsurface structures. These methods analyze variations in **density** and **magnetic susceptibility** to map geological formations. However, inverting this data to obtain meaningful subsurface models presents challenges due to **non-uniqueness**, **noise**, and **outliers** in data.  

In this blog, we introduce a **compact inversion technique** based on the **Huber loss function**, which improves model stability and reduces the influence of outliers. This method achieves **better convergence** and **higher accuracy** compared to traditional inversion techniques.  

---

### **1. Forward Modeling**  
**Forward modeling** calculates the geophysical response caused by subsurface features. It is based on the mathematical relationship between observed data and model parameters.  

For **gravity data**, the relationship is given by:  

\[
f(r) = \int_V A(r, r_0) \kappa(r_0) d^3r_0
\]  

where:  
- \( f(r) \): Observed gravity field.  
- \( A(r, r_0) \): Kernel function (Green’s function).  
- \( \kappa(r_0) \): Density or magnetization.  

For **magnetic data**, the kernel is:  

\[
A(r, r_0) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \alpha \partial \beta} \left( \frac{1}{\|r - r_0\|} \right)
\]  

---

### **2. Inverse Modeling**  
Inversion estimates the source parameters (density or magnetization) by minimizing the difference between observed and predicted data. The general form of the **linear inverse problem** is:  

\[
d = A m + e
\]  

where:  
- \( d \): Observed data.  
- \( A \): Sensitivity matrix.  
- \( m \): Model parameters.  
- \( e \): Error vector.  

To stabilize the inversion, we minimize an **objective function**:  

\[
\Phi = \Phi_d + \beta \Phi_m
\]  

where:  
- \( \Phi_d \): Data misfit.  
- \( \Phi_m \): Model smoothness constraint.  
- \( \beta \): Trade-off parameter.  

---

### **3. Huber Loss Function**  
A major limitation of traditional inversion is its sensitivity to **outliers**. The **Huber loss function** overcomes this by combining **L1 (absolute error)** and **L2 (squared error)** norms.  

\[
L_\delta(r) =
\begin{cases} 
\frac{1}{2} r^2 & \text{for } |r| \leq \delta \\
\delta(|r| - \frac{1}{2}\delta) & \text{otherwise} 
\end{cases}
\]  

This function behaves quadratically for small errors (smooth convergence) and linearly for large errors (robust to outliers).  

---

### **4. Depth and Compactness Weighting**  
**Depth weighting** is applied to compensate for the natural decay of sensitivity with depth. It is defined as:  

\[
w(z) = (z + z_0)^{-\beta/2}
\]  

where:  
- \( z \): Depth of the model cell.  
- \( z_0 \): Small constant to prevent singularities.  
- \( \beta \): Decay rate, typically 2 for gravity and 3 for magnetic data.  

**Compactness weighting** promotes smaller, localized anomalies:  

\[
w(m_j) = (\epsilon + |m_j|^2)^{(\alpha - 2)/4}
\]  

where \( \alpha \) controls the compactness.

### **5. Real-World Application**  
The method was applied to **gravity data** from the **Pyhäsalmi mine in Finland**, a site with complex ore bodies. The Huber loss function effectively reduced noise and produced sharper boundaries compared to traditional methods, demonstrating its robustness in field applications.  

---

### **6. Advantages of Huber Loss Function**  
- **Robustness Against Outliers**: Reduces the impact of noise and large residuals.  
- **Faster Convergence**: Fewer iterations required compared to L1 and L2 norms.  
- **Improved Model Accuracy**: Produces geologically meaningful models with sharper features.  
- **Flexibility**: Applicable to both synthetic and real datasets with varying noise levels.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
This blog demonstrated the principles behind **forward and inverse modeling** for gravity and magnetic data, highlighting the advantages of using the **Huber loss function**. The method offers significant improvements in robustness, speed, and accuracy, making it an essential tool for geophysical modeling.
