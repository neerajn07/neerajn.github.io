**RadSIMU: Simulating Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry Surveys**  
======  

**RadSIMU** is a radiometric simulation tool designed to optimize **survey planning** and improve data accuracy for **airborne gamma-ray spectrometry (AGRS)**. It models radiation intensity based on **UAV flight parameters**, **sensor configurations**, and **terrain corrections**, providing an efficient approach to simulate and analyze survey results before field deployment.  

### **Key Features of RadSIMU**  
- **Synthetic Terrain Generation**: Models realistic terrains using **Perlin noise** and incorporates geological features like **faults** and **ridges**.  
- **Dual-Sensor Support**: Simulates data acquisition for both **radiometric** and **magnetic sensors**, allowing integrated geophysical analysis.  
- **Survey Optimization**: Tests different UAV heights, grid resolutions, and sampling rates to identify the best configurations for data collection.  
- **Terrain Correction Algorithms**: Implements improved **terrain correction methods** to minimize biases caused by topographic variations.  
- **Forward Modeling and Inversion**: Combines forward simulations with **sensitivity analysis** to predict survey outcomes and refine data interpretation.  

### **Applications**  
RadSIMU is particularly useful in:  
- **Mineral Exploration**: Identifying radioactive anomalies and subsurface features.  
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Assessing radiation levels for safety and remediation planning.  
- **Survey Planning**: Evaluating survey designs before execution to optimize cost and coverage.  

### **Why RadSIMU?**  
The simulator provides a cost-effective and time-saving approach to plan **UAV-based AGRS surveys**. It ensures high-resolution data collection while addressing terrain-induced distortions, making it ideal for both academic research and industry applications.
