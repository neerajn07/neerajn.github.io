Title: Analysis of seismo-Ionospheric coupling using the DEMETER satelliteg
<br/><img src='/images/demeter.jpg'>"

Abstract:
======
Advancements in-ground and space-based measurements provide an opportunity to measure the perturbation in the Ionosphere. Ground-based measurements help us measure the solar flux, external field, etc., that can be separated from the satellite data anomalies. This paper analyzed the ionospheric perturbations caused by the Sumatra earthquake on March 28, 2005. DEMETER satellite mission was dedicated to measuring the ionospheric perturbations related to seismic events. We analyzed the datasets from March 1 to April 30, i.e., one month before and after the mainshock. Also, we analyzed geomagnetic storms within the same range to distinguish between the precursors and the external disturbances. Analysis of satellite data shows a significant change in the Electric field energy amplitude, variations in ions density, and temperature during the earthquake process. The concept of lithospheric-atmospheric-ionospheric (LAI) coupling is also described to explain the earthquake preparation zone.

Summary:
======
- This research shows the relations of ionospheric perturbations in relation to seismicity. 
- Coherency was observed in the ICE VLF spectrum, Ion temperature, Ion den-
sity, electron current, and ion current one week before the mainshock.
