This paper introduces a MATLAB-based 2D resistivity inversion algorithm that employs the damped least squares method. The algorithm's performance is validated by comparing its results with those obtained from the standard RES2DINV software, demonstrating its effectiveness in processing time-lapse Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) data. Field data acquired during pre- and post-monsoon periods at the IIT Kanpur campus were analyzed to identify potential conduits for groundwater recharge. The study highlights the algorithm's robustness in delineating water-bearing formations and estimating their depth and thickness, offering a valuable tool for geophysical investigations.
