I am a Geophysicist and Ph.D. candidate at Queen’s University, under the guidance of [Dr. Alexander Braun](http://sea-level.org) at the Department of Geological Sciences and Engineering at Queen’s University. My studies focus on UAV borne Magnetic and Radiometric data, building on a foundation in Geological Technology and Geosciences Engineering.

Throughout my career, I have gained substantial hands-on experience in various geophysical data acquisition and modeling techniques, in particular I have worked on:
 * Potential field methods: Gravity, Magnetic and ERT
 * RPAS application in mineral exploration: Magnetic, Radiometrics, and Hyperspectral
 * Numerical method: Finite difference method, Spectral infinite element method (SPECFEM)
 * Solving Poisson's/Laplace equations

I completed my master's degree in May 2020 at the [Department of Earth Sciences](https://www.iitk.ac.in/es/) under the supervision of [Dr. Animesh Mandal](https://sites.google.com/view/animesh-mandal/home), Where I study groundwater modeling using Electrical resistivity tomography.

Outside academia, I am an avid cyclist and runner, often exploring the scenic routes around Lake Ontario. I also enjoy teaching.
