This presentation focuses on **improved spectral analysis and terrain correction methods** for airborne **gamma-ray spectrometry (AGRS)**. My research explores the use of **UAV-borne magnetic and radiometric data** for mineral exploration and subsurface characterization. The talk highlights advancements in terrain correction algorithms, leveraging **synthetic simulations** and **real-world field data** to improve data accuracy over rugged topographies.

Key highlights from the presentation:
- Development of a **spatial analysis method** for isotope peak detection.  
- Novel techniques for **terrain correction** to minimize biases caused by topographic variations.  
- Simulation tools for designing **survey plans** and optimizing flight parameters for **gamma-ray spectrometry** using UAVs.  
- Applications of **numerical methods**, including **finite difference methods** and **spectral infinite element methods (SPECFEM)**, for geophysical modeling.  

The methodology presented combines **forward modeling**, **sensitivity analysis**, and **inversion techniques** to achieve higher resolution and improved detection of radioactive anomalies. Results demonstrate the potential of these approaches in advancing **mineral exploration** and **environmental monitoring**.
