*GammaSpec: Identifying and Labeling Isotopes in Gamma-Ray Spectrometry*  
======  

**GammaSpec** is a gamma-ray spectrometry (AGRS) tool designed for the detection, identification, and labeling of isotopes in radiometric data. It combines spectrum analysis and calibration techniques to enhance isotope recognition, making it a powerful solution for radiometric surveys and environmental monitoring.  

### Key Features of GammaSpec  
- Isotope Identification: Detects and labels key isotopes, such as Uranium (U), Thorium (Th), and Potassium (K), based on their characteristic energy peaks.  
- Peak Detection Algorithms: Uses spatial filtering and multi-channel analysis for accurate peak identification.  
- Energy Calibration: Ensures precise calibration of energy channels for improved peak resolution and isotope detection.  
- Noise Reduction: Applies smoothing algorithms to enhance signal-to-noise ratios, making weak peaks more detectable.  
- Terrain Correction: Compensates for topographic effects to reduce biases caused by altitude and elevation changes.  

### Applications  
GammaSpec is ideal for:  
- Mineral Exploration: Locating natural radioactive deposits and anomalies.  
- Environmental Monitoring: Assessing radiation levels for safety and compliance.  
- Geological Surveys: Mapping subsurface compositions using radiometric signatures.  
- Research and Education: Training and demonstrations in geophysical studies.  

### Why GammaSpec?  
GammaSpec simplifies gamma-ray data processing by providing accurate isotope labeling and real-time analysis. It supports UAV-borne surveys, allowing researchers to process large datasets efficiently while accounting for terrain variations.
